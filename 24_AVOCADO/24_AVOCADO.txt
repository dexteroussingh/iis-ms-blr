1) Women Safety

Pre- existing apps: features not provided = alerting by voice and notification to the nearby police station and power of voice to trigger.

MapMyIndia APIs used: nearby API, geocode API, routing API

CRUX: 1) IMEI number   2)Nearby Police Stations     3) Illeterate people also taken into considering using the NLP engine

Pre- Emergency Situations:
1) Real-time crowd density of a place
2) Patroling Activity, Street Light etc.


Market Viability:

CROWD density
Understanding how many people pass by a given location at a given time helps urban planners to better understand and meet people'sâ€™ needs:

1) Helps the business know the popularity of a particular place

2) Allows them to know the insights of a place through which they can know about the needs of the crowd in that particular region.

3) Helps them understand crowd flow at large-scale events and where to position different amenities like food stalls, parking in case of large gathering events.


Car Crash Savior:

Around 3 Lakh car accident victims die every year because of the late response in getting medical attention.

Every 1 minute delay in response time correlates to a six percent difference in number of lives saved.

CRUX:

1)Reduced the time to the shortest extent possible by using automated service and removing middlemen.

2) Car acts in the post crash scenario (which can be addded as a market feature for the current automobile industry).
